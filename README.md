# Excuse me waiter, I would like...

Made in 3 hours for [Trijam #88: Hot Potato](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-88)

## Description:
You arrive at a resturant somewhere in the world, and must
use your linguistic intuition to order a delicious hot potato.
Be careful not to order mashed banana instead, or worse, disgusting cold spaghetti!

## My take on the theme, "Hot potato"
Hot potato, cold spaghetti, and mashed banana are mentioned in the song [Hot Potato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qho9o4zRwtE) by The Wiggles.



## Technical approach
Made using [Vue.js](), a javascript framework.

The translations were generated using the [google translate](https://gsuitetips.com/tips/sheets/translate-languages-in-google-sheets/) funtion in google sheets.
